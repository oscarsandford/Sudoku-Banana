# Sudoku Banana
### Distinctly banana.

Creates and solves sudoku puzzles in nxn dimensions.<br>

Terminal run with arguments: ```java SudokuSolver <int:a> <int:b> <int:c>```<br>

One can use the program with as many inputs as desired.
No arguments will make 1 puzzle of 9x9 dimensions with space factor 2. <br>

```int:a```: dimension of puzzle (must be a perfect square) <br>
```int:b```: number of puzzles to create and try to solve <br>
```int:c```: space factor or proportion of spaces compared to hints on initial puzzle <br>

My hint algorithm doesn't always made valid sudokus, so the program will run and give a success rate and show completed puzzles. Kind of cool and I might add to this down the road. <br>

This code is horrendous and is not to be surveyed by the faint of heart.
